        * __config.php__ __[REQUIRED]__ Should contain the following variables: 
            * `fullname` :string

            *  Should contain the function `module_{{examplemod}}_getBlockData(courseid:int)` that returns an associative array with all the data that is required for the dashboard module.
            * [IF `hasDetails` is set to `true`] Should contain the function `module_{{examplemod}}_getDetailsData(courseid:int)` that returns an associative array with all the data that is required for the details module. 
        * __block.js__ [IF `blockJS` is set to `true`]
            *  Should contain a function `{{examplemod}}_block_init(data:json)` That is called when the data from the `module.php` function is available.
        * __block.css__ [IF `blockCSS` is set to `true`]
            * Contains styling rules for the module on the dashboard. All rules should have a `{{examplemod}}_block_` prefix.
