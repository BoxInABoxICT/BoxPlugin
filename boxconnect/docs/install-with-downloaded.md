# Installing with the downloaded plugin
If you're here, it's probably because zip installation is disabled for your Moodle instance, if that's not the case, we recommend you [install with the zip file](install-with-zip.md). If zip installation is disabled you can follow the steps below to get the plugin installed on your Moodle instance.

1. Unzip the downloaded ["boxconnect.zip"](/../boxconnect.zip) file and move the contents into the `local/` directory from the root of your Moodle directory.
